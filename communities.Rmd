# Coding with communities {#communities} 

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```


## Prelude

This is a brief (incomplete) introduction to the idea of coding with communities. We will explore: What are open science coding communities? Why participate in them? And also how Twitter as a legit coding tool. 

This is currently focused on R communities, but we'll be adding more examples from Python and beyond. 

There are 2 slide decks associated:

- [Coding With Communities](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17HSNmBYvPw-7Prioys7WIhL9QGVb3s3bJCLaAJVaChc/edit?usp=sharing), which we go through in a Cohort Call
- [Discovering Community Tools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1czvMz7a84jkaYDwHlG1cuKyf9B0mciQJVOFcc7hZtpU/edit?usp=sharing), which teams review during a Seaside Chat

## Open science / coding communities connect online and in person

Most communities have some degree of in-person and online presence, with Twitter being a big part of that online presence. 

And Twitter is a legit tool for learning R. We connect using the #rstats hashtag, and thus often called the “rstats community”. 

Here are some examples of communities. Read more & direct links: <https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/collaborating.html#r-communities>

There are strategies for learning with both online and local communities. 

## So why participate? 

- Skillshare (teach & learn) 
  - Coding, software, workflows
  - Collaboration, leadership
- Meet allies, grow friendships, build networks
- Help improve science & scientific culture 
  - Increase visibility & value of coding, data, collaboration skills
  - Drive change: formally teach in environmental science! Include as academic evaluation (we shouldn’t really have to teach ourselves on our own time), create jobs 
- Carry on & forward your experience from Openscapes

## How to get started? 

[Seaside Chats](https://github.com/Openscapes/seaside-chats#seaside-chats) are a great start,
