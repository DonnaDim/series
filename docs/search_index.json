It is under heavy development. The Openscapes Champions program is designed to meet scientists where they are and help identify incremental steps to make their data workflows more efficient and open. The lessons were developed from Our path to better science in less time, using the topics discussed in that paper as a guide. The program is modeled after Mozilla’s Open Leadership Training Series. Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp; Synthesis (NCEAS) and is being incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Julia Stewart Lowndes. "],

The first half of the series focuses on the lab, and then opening up beyond the lab. In this training you will learn R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub. It’s going to be fun and empowering! You will learn a reproducible workflow that can be used in research and analyses of all kinds, including Ocean Health Index assessments. This is really powerful, cool stuff, and not just for data: I made and published this book using those four tools and workflow. 2.1 Why we’re here We’re all scientists because we want to make a difference. But — Data analysis can be inefficient and demoralizing when you’re without the right tools/skills and you feel alone But open tools, practices, and communities exist that are powerful and empowering And we can learn and use open practices for science And to make science more of a collaborative effort with everyone valued and able to contribute in their own way. Openscapes is a program operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp; Synthesis (NCEAS) and is being incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Julia Stewart Lowndes. It stems from the data struggles of the Ocean Health Index, and the game-changing approaches that led to Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. We’ve been building Openscapes from an open data science angle, but along with that comes the mindset of openness, collaboration, good intentions, and creating the culture we want in science. 2.2 What to expect This is going to be a fun course. There are no skills required to participate, and we will not be teaching how to code or set up databases. Instead, we will be provide an opportunity to learn about existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and stay accountable. analysis_final_v2.xlsx Re:FWD:Fwd:Data question We’ll talk about tools and practices broadly, but also with specific examples using R and GitHub. Yes, software will change, but seeing what is possible and becoming versed in embracing existing architecture and practices can save a lot of time — and will be transferrable skills as the actual software changes. Analogy: if you learn one musical instrument, you will be able to learn another one more fluidly than if you have never learned one to begin with. The plan is to expose you to a lot of great tools and practices that you can have confidence using in your research. The point is to expose you to what is possible and help you start planning and also actually incrementally weaving them into your existing workflows. The point is not to overwhelm you or make you feel like it’s too late for you or that you would need to throw out and redo everything you’ve ever done in order to take the first step. No. By seeing what’s possible and how shared practices can make your own life easier, and life easier and more streamlined and fun with your lab and beyond, you’ll start experimenting with these practices and in a few years you will be working in a completely different way. You’ll be working hands-on and doing the same things on your own computer as we do live on up on the screen. We’re going to go through a lot in these two days and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll have experience with it and confidence that you can do it. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to approach your analyses; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. If you expect and appreciate that, you will be more efficient in doing your awesome science. You are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. You are encouraged to help each other. Everyone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. Instructors and helpers learn something new every time, from each other and from your questions. If you are already familiar with some of this material, focus on how we teach, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this training is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole. 2.3 What’s possible with open data science (demo) github for collaborating (code, text) R for automation, visualizations bookdown websites shiny github for project management organize by project, i.e., keep that code and those methods in same parent folder, rather than all the R code you’ve ever written being in a giant folder, spanning projects public &amp; private issues, tagging people on commits, kaban board Live: fix a tpyo and republish the book/page Personal: - I don’t have all the answers, but I expect them and know how to look - I build websites with RStudio+GitHub - Personal website: I link to pubs, slide decks, and interviews/media 2.4 What you’ll learn Seeing what’s possible opens up what you expect 2.5 Deliverables The deliverables for the program are as follows. Openscapes Roadmap for your lab (Table 1) Seaside chats Study groups Become Champions – for your labs, departments, communities. 2.5.1 Assignments There will be assignments between each call that should take about two hours over two weeks. Assignments are designed to be done during lab “data chats”, weekly meetings to discuss data workflows and establish shared practices. 2.6 Additional reading Practical Computing for Biologists. Introduction to the Terminal/command line, introduction to regular expressions. Chapter 2 alone. "],

In the big picture, you’re contributing to how we understand and interact with the natural world. In a narrower sense, Collaborating efficiently has historically been really hard to do. It’s only been the last 20 years or so that we’ve moved beyond mailing things with the postal service. Being able to email and get feedback on files through track changes was a huge step forward, but it comes with a lot of bookkeeping and reproduciblity issues (did I do my analyses with thesis_final_final.xls or thesis_final_usethisone.xls?). But now, open tools make it much easier to collaborate. Working with collaborators in mind is critical for reproducibility. And, your most important collaborator is Future You. This training will introduce best practices using open tools, so that collaboration will become second nature to you! 3.2 Data science as a discipline analysis_final_v2.xlsx Re:FWD:Fwd:Data question your science is not unique when it comes to data expect there is a way to do what you want to do There are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data Emphasis on communication Not just for “big data” Your study system is not unique when it comes to data 3.3 Open science as a mindset/ Openness as a XXX not only about sharing your data 3.4 Lab members as a team Science is collaborative. data &amp; workflows lab meeting “nuts and bolts” 3.5 Communities for learning, teaching, and mentorship 3.6 The Internet as an underleveraged tool for science "],
