It is under heavy development. It is modeled after Mozilla’s Open Leadership Training Series. Openscapes is run by Julia Stewart Lowndes, a Mozilla Fellow and marine scientist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp; Synthesis (NCEAS). Learn more at openscapes.org. "],

In this training you will learn R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub. It’s going to be fun and empowering! You will learn a reproducible workflow that can be used in research and analyses of all kinds, including Ocean Health Index assessments. This is really powerful, cool stuff, and not just for data: I made and published this book using those four tools and workflow. 2.1 What to expect This is going to be a fun course. The plan is to expose you to a lot of great tools that you can have confidence using in your research. You’ll be working hands-on and doing the same things on your own computer as we do live on up on the screen. We’re going to go through a lot in these two days and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll have experience with it and confidence that you can do it. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to approach your analyses; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. If you expect and appreciate that, you will be more efficient in doing your awesome science. You are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. You are encouraged to help each other. Everyone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. Instructors and helpers learn something new every time, from each other and from your questions. If you are already familiar with some of this material, focus on how we teach, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this training is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole. 2.2 What you’ll learn 2.3 Data science as a mindset analysis_final_v2.xlsx Re:FWD:Fwd:Data question your science is not unique when it comes to data expect there is a way to do what you want to do 2.4 Lab members as a team - data &amp; workflows lab meeting “nuts and bolts” 2.5 Communities for learning, teaching, and mentorship 2.6 The Internet as an unleveraged tool for science (or intro to Julie?) - I don&#39;t have all the answers, but I expect them and know how to look - I build websites with RStudio+GitHub - Personal website: I link to pubs, slide decks, and interviews/media 2.7 Emphasizing collaboration Collaborating efficiently has historically been really hard to do. It’s only been the last 20 years or so that we’ve moved beyond mailing things with the postal service. Being able to email and get feedback on files through track changes was a huge step forward, but it comes with a lot of bookkeeping and reproduciblity issues (did I do my analyses with thesis_final_final.xls or thesis_final_usethisone.xls?). But now, open tools make it much easier to collaborate. Working with collaborators in mind is critical for reproducibility. And, your most important collaborator is Future You. This training will introduce best practices using open tools, so that collaboration will become second nature to you! 2.8 By the end of the course… By the end of the course, you’ll wrangle a few different data sets, and make your own graphics that you’ll publish on webpages you’ve built collaboratively with GitHub and RMarkdown. Woop! "],
["champion.html", "Chapter 3 Be a champion for open science 3.1 Objectives and Resources 3.2 Three messages 3.3 Build community", " Chapter 3 Be a champion for open science in development… 3.1 Objectives and Resources To provide resources for you to promote good practices for open and reproducible science in your communities and institutions. 3.2 Three messages If there are 3 things to communicate to others after this workshop, I think they would be: 1. Data science is a discipline that can improve your analyses There are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data. Your study system is not unique when it comes to data, and accepting this will speed up your analyses. This helps your science: Think deliberately about data: when you distinguish data questions from research questions, you’ll learn how and who to ask for help Save heartache: you don’t have to reinvent the wheel Save time: when you expect there’s a better way to do what you are doing, you’ll find the solution faster. Focus on the science. 2. Open data science tools exist Data science tools that enable open science are game-changing for analysis, collaboration and communication. Open science is “the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers” (Hampton et al. 2015)) This helps your science: Have confidence in your analyses from this traceable, reusable record Save time through automation, thinking ahead of your immediate task, reduced bookkeeping, and collaboration Take advantage of convenient access: working openly online is like having an extended memory 3. Learn these tools with collaborators and community (redefined): Your most important collaborator is Future You. Community should also be beyond the colleagues in your field. Learn from, with, and for others. This helps your science: If you learn to talk about your data, you’ll find solutions faster. Build confidence: these skills are transferable beyond your science. Be empathetic and inclusive and build a network of allies 3.3 Build community Join existing communities locally and online, and start local chapters with friends! Some ideas: Mozilla Study Groups Example: Eco-data-science. Also see (Steven et al. 2018) RLadies. Example: RLadies Santa Barbara These meetups can be for skill-sharing, showcasing how people work, or building community so you can troubleshoot together. They can be an informal “hacky hour” at a cafe or pub! "]
