It is under heavy development. It is modeled after Mozilla’s Open Leadership Training Series. Openscapes is run by Julia Stewart Lowndes, a Mozilla Fellow and marine scientist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp; Synthesis (NCEAS). Learn more at openscapes.org. "],
["overview.html", "Chapter 2 Overview 2.1 Why we’re here 2.2 What to expect 2.3 What’s possible with open data science (demo) 2.4 What you’ll learn 2.5 Deliverables", " Chapter 2 Overview Welcome. In this training you will learn R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub. It’s going to be fun and empowering! You will learn a reproducible workflow that can be used in research and analyses of all kinds, including Ocean Health Index assessments. This is really powerful, cool stuff, and not just for data: I made and published this book using those four tools and workflow. 2.1 Why we’re here We’re all scientists because we want to make a difference. But — Data analysis can be inefficient and demoralizing when you’re without the right tools/skills and you feel alone But open tools, practices, and communities exist that are powerful and empowering And we can learn and use open practices for science And to make science more of a collaborative effort with everyone valued and able to contribute in their own way. Openscapes is a program operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp; Synthesis (NCEAS) and is being incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Julia Stewart Lowndes. It stems from the data struggles of the Ocean Health Index, and the game-changing approaches that led to Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. We’ve been building Openscapes from an open data science angle, but along with that comes the mindset of openness, collaboration, good intentions, and creating the culture we want in science. 2.2 What to expect This is going to be a fun course. There are no skills required to participate, and we will not be teaching how to code or set up databases. Instead, we will be provide an opportunity to learn about existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and stay accountable. analysis_final_v2.xlsx Re:FWD:Fwd:Data question The plan is to expose you to a lot of great tools that you can have confidence using in your research. You’ll be working hands-on and doing the same things on your own computer as we do live on up on the screen. We’re going to go through a lot in these two days and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll have experience with it and confidence that you can do it. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to approach your analyses; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. If you expect and appreciate that, you will be more efficient in doing your awesome science. You are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. You are encouraged to help each other. Everyone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. Instructors and helpers learn something new every time, from each other and from your questions. If you are already familiar with some of this material, focus on how we teach, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this training is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole. 2.3 What’s possible with open data science (demo) github for collaborating (code, text) R for automation, visualizations bookdown websites shiny Personal: - I don’t have all the answers, but I expect them and know how to look - I build websites with RStudio+GitHub - Personal website: I link to pubs, slide decks, and interviews/media 2.4 What you’ll learn Seeing what’s possible opens up what you expect 2.5 Deliverables The deliverables for the program are as follows.

In the big picture, you’re contributing to how we understand and interact with the natural world. In a narrower sense, Collaborating efficiently has historically been really hard to do. It’s only been the last 20 years or so that we’ve moved beyond mailing things with the postal service. Being able to email and get feedback on files through track changes was a huge step forward, but it comes with a lot of bookkeeping and reproduciblity issues (did I do my analyses with thesis_final_final.xls or thesis_final_usethisone.xls?). But now, open tools make it much easier to collaborate. Working with collaborators in mind is critical for reproducibility. And, your most important collaborator is Future You. This training will introduce best practices using open tools, so that collaboration will become second nature to you! 3.2 Data science as a discipline analysis_final_v2.xlsx Re:FWD:Fwd:Data question your science is not unique when it comes to data expect there is a way to do what you want to do There are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data Emphasis on communication Not just for “big data” Your study system is not unique when it comes to data 3.3 Open science as a mindset/ Openness as a XXX not only about sharing your data 3.4 Lab members as a team Science is collaborative. data &amp; workflows lab meeting “nuts and bolts” 3.5 Communities for learning, teaching, and mentorship 3.6 The Internet as an underleveraged tool for science "],
