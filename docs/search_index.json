It is under heavy development; some chapters are only notes at this point. Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice. We mentor early career environmental researchers in leadership roles – faculty, lecturers, program managers, and others who want to establish open data science practices in their labs and on their campuses. It is designed to meet scientists where they are and help identify incremental steps to make their data workflows more efficient and open. We’ve been building Openscapes from an open data science angle, but along with that comes the mindset of openness, collaboration, good intentions, and creating the culture we want in science. Note: “lab” is broadly defined. The Series is framed around Lowndes et al. 2017, Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. That paper is a retrospective of how a team’s data workflow changed over four years; the Openscapes Series aims to help guide other labs to incrementally make similar progress themselves, no matter where they are starting from. 1.1 Agendas The first half of the Series focuses on efficiency and open culture within the lab, and the second half is about sustained learning and bringing these practices to the broader campus community. This Series is taught over a five-month period, with two Cohort Calls each month with Champions and their lab members. Calls are designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and participation through Google Docs and Zoom (group and breakouts). Call agendas and slides are all available in a Google Folder, and identified individually here: Agendas Chapters Slides 1. Openscapes overview &amp; mindset overview, mindset overview, mindset 2. Better science in less time better science in less time better science in less time, data interlude 3. Lab culture lab culture, code of conduct lab culture, code of conduct 4.

And also, awesomely, it’s created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: R and RStudio — specifially bookdown — and GitHub. Openscapes is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp; Synthesis (NCEAS) and is being incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Julia Stewart Lowndes. "],
["overview.html", "Chapter 2 Overview 2.1 Why we’re here 2.2 What to expect 2.3 What’s possible with open data science (demo) 2.4 What we’ll learn 2.5 Deliverables 2.6 Additional reading", " Chapter 2 Overview Welcome. Our vision is a scientific culture that is more efficient and collaborative, and can uncover environmental solutions faster. This Series is going to be fun and empowering! We will talk about a lot of tools and practices to make your science more streamlined. This is really powerful, cool stuff, and not just for data: I made and published this book using the tools and workflows we’ll talk about. The first half of the Series focuses on efficiency and open culture within the lab, and the second half is about sustained learning and bringing these practices to the broader campus community. 2.1 Why we’re here We are passionate environmental scientists studying important, time-sensitive topics using data of all kinds. And we were never taught to work efficiently with data. Data analysis can be inefficient and demoralizing when you’re without the right tools/skills and you feel alone. But! Open tools, practices, and communities exist that are powerful and empowering, and game-changing for science. And we can learn and use open practices for science. They are like the Force from Star Wars: More powerful than you ever imagined Helps you solve your current question powerfully – but also broadens the scope of the questions you can ask Learn from jedis, pass on what you have learned, have a ton of awesome allies (and not all allies are jedis) 2.2 What to expect 2.2.1 This is going to be fun and empowering! We are going to be discussing a wide range of topics and working to seed habits for you to engage and learn with them with our lab and others on campus. 2.2.2 Exposure to relevant tools &amp; practices, confidence &amp; agency to engage, community to learn with The plan is to expose you to a lot of great tools and practices that you can have confidence using in your research. We will also spend time helping you plan how to actually incrementally weave them into your existing workflows. The point is not to overwhelm you or make you feel like it’s too late for you or that you would need to throw out and redo everything you’ve ever done in order to take the first step. No. By seeing what’s possible and how shared practices can make your own life easier, and life easier and more streamlined and fun with your lab and beyond, you’ll start experimenting with these practices and in a few years you will be working in a completely different way. 2.2.3 Create a shared culture – in your lab, on campus, and beyond We’re going to go through a lot and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll know what is possible, have confidence that you can do it, and have allies so you’re not alone. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to approach your analyses; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. If you expect and appreciate that, you will be more efficient in doing your awesome science. 2.2.4 No skills required. We will strategize about general approaches, specific examples using R/RStudio and GitHub There are no skills required to participate, and we will not be teaching hands-on how to code or set up databases. But we will be talking about how these are important and fit together in the big picture, and how to get started learning the skills you need. This is an opportunity to discuss existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and stay accountable. We’ll talk about tools and practices broadly, but also with specific examples using R and GitHub. Won’t that software eventually become outdated you say — is it worth learning them over something else? The answer is yes, software will change and become outdated; it always has. But seeing what is possible and becoming versed in embracing existing architecture and practices will set you up to make whatever transition comes, and you will make this transition with the community, not along. Your skills will be transferrable skills as the actual software changes. Analogy: if you learn one musical instrument, you will be able to learn another one more fluidly than if you have never learned one to begin with because maybe you can read music, understand something about timing and rhythm, etc. 2.2.5 Everyone is coming with different experiences &amp; expectations Everyone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. You are encouraged to ask questions and answer those of others. 2.2.6 We are all learning together These tools are new to all of us, and the best ideas come from questions from anyone. If you are already familiar with some of this material, think about how your experience was learning it, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this Series is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole. 2.2.7 Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no. Shame is not allowed here. No “I’m 34 and haven’t learned GitHub, it’s too late for me” or any of that. We have never had the opportunity to learn these things, there should be no shame on your part for that. It takes a lot of time and dedicated effort to learn and employ these practices, and they should be valued and taught. That’s why you’re here now, you should be proud that you are taking the initiative and your time to do this. No shame. Vulnerability, however, will be involved in this Series. Vulnerability is a big part of learning and trying new things — this is a safe place for everyone to learn. Vulnerability is taking stock of where you are now and help you map out where you want to be. Being vulnerable is scary. But it shouldn’t be lonely: we all have data confessions that would love to talk about and get help with, if only our scientific culture said that was OK; if only we knew how to articulate our questions and have someone to ask. This is a place to share our vulnerabilities to ignite real change. Ask questions. Whether it’s a keyboard shortcut or philosophy of data workflows, ask and let’s talk about it. 2.2.8 Everyone is welcome here You are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. We are setting a tone of mutual respect and a space place for learning where we assume good intentions and interact with kindness and empathy. Pass it on. 2.3 What’s possible with open data science (demo) R for automation, visualizations github for collaborating (code, text) bookdown websites github for project management organize by project, i.e., keep that code and those methods in same parent folder, rather than all the R code you’ve ever written being in a giant folder, spanning projects public &amp; private issues, tagging people on commits, kaban board Live: fix a tpyo and republish the book/page 2.4 What we’ll learn 2.4.1 Expect that there is a better way Seeing what’s possible opens up what you expect. There is a bit of a chicken and egg issue here: you need to be exposed to things so you know what’s possible and what skills to develop, but you need to kind of know what to look for so you can absorb what you are exposed to. 2.4.2 Have agency to find it Break down that “I teach you learn” model. We are all here to learn and improve. Learning horizontally. This series is not about micro-managing your science but about providing guidance &amp; structure so that everyone in the lab is not silently struggling to reinvent the wheel and coming up with weird homegrown data approaches. What skills you should have and what you should be thinking of, along with some of the tools you can use. Will be building out the Resources page on the website for this purpose. And search the blogs. 2.4.3 Have community to learn with No more silently struggling &amp; reinventing the wheel &amp; creating weird, homegrown workarounds. Embrace emerging and established community best practices 2.4.4 Identify what skills and tools you need, map next steps &amp; learn 2.5 Deliverables aka Outcomes. Be champions for open data science (in your labs, departments, communities.) A more open culture in your lab dedicated lab meetings to discuss data workflows “Seaside chats” (&lt;- this is what we call them at OHI) stated code of conduct or lab philosophy beginnings of a lab roadmap of shared data workflows A growing community of practice on campus study groups / coding clubs (ex: Eco-Data-Science) hacky hours 2.5.1 What would you do in a Seaside Chat?

Let’s plan a lab “hackathon” to move these .xls to .csv files we store on Github 2.5.2 What would you do in a Seaside Chat? Example lessons from Eco-Data-Science (&lt;- all lessons linked “previous sessions”) Introduction to GitHub Text analysis in R Spatial analysis in R Free websites with RMarkdown Animated plots in R with ggplot2 &amp; gganimate Intro to Python 2.5.3 Assignments There will be assignments between each call that should take about two hours over two weeks. Assignments are designed to be done during lab “Seaside chats”, weekly meetings to discuss data workflows and establish shared practices. Assigned after each call. Do them collaboratively during lab “Seaside chats”. They should take take 2 hours (over 2 weeks). Come prepared to debrief in the following Cohort Call! 2.6 Additional reading Practical Computing for Biologists. Introduction to the Terminal/command line, introduction to regular expressions.

No matter what your study system or your question, to Do Your Science you will need to get your data into analytical software, wrangle it (tidy and transform), and make sense of it visually and with models. Very important here: tidy your data first, don’t build your whole analysis around whatever weird format your data may have come in. We’ll talk about tidy data in more detail another day. R for Data Science 3.1.1 There are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data Just like a field chemistry has concepts for things like moleculte, theory for how they work, and tools for studying them, so does data science — for data. 3.1.2 Emphasis on communication It is incredible what is possible on the communication front. Watch this one-minute video called What is RMarkdown? to blow your mind. 3.1.3 Not just for “big data” 3.1.4 Your study system is not unique when it comes to data Think about your data separately from your study system. Don’t confound them or it will be really hard to ask for help. Expect there is a way to do what you want to do. This will help you find commonalities and unite you with other lab members and beyond. 3.1.5 Distinguish data questions from research questions, learn how to ask for help 3.2 Open data science tools exist 3.2.1 Tools to match data science theory Wickham 2017 3.2.2 They exist to streamline working with data 3.2.3 And they are developed by actual people – nice people! 3.2.4 My advice 3.2.4.1 Expect there is a better way If you’re making the same plot 10 times, stop. Don’t confound data science with your science. Expect that someone has had your problem before or done what you want to do. 3.2.4.2 Divorce your science question from the data science question Focus on the operations for the data, not your hypothesis 3.2.4.3 Google your question (ask for help) Articulate it, and identify useful solutions Trusted urls, recent dates 3.3 Open as a way to work 3.3.1 Open science as a way to be more efficient and streamlined Not an added ask at publication to share your data It’s not only about sharing data. It’s about how you work, who you include, and the tools that you use. 3.3.2 External memory (personal and collective) Easier on/offboarding 3.3.3 Find solutions faster – learn to talk about your data 3.3.4 Build confidence – skills are transferable beyond your science 3.3.5 Be empathic and inclusive – grow a network of allies 3.4 Lab members as a team Science is collaborative. Not heads down elbows out. 3.4.1 Focus on what unites lab members, not what sets them apart 3.4.2 Think of the lab horizontally as skillsets &amp; needs instead of vertically as science bins Instead of the skills you have when you come to the lab determining how you will be able to Do Science, have shared practices in the lab and paths to onboard new people to work that way as well. 3.5 Learn with collaborators and community (redefined) Communities for learning, teaching, and mentorship. 3.5.1 Helps overcome isolation, self-taught bad practices, apprehension Stevens et al. 2018 ### Your most important collaborator is Future You Cannot emphasize this enough.

We are going to talk about GitHub, and learn about using it for publication and project management. We will focus on collaboration and communication with hands-on practice. We are going to work with GitHub from the browser only, because it makes the best use of our short time together. It is also a powerful way for folks to contribute and collaborate even if they are not involved in day-to-day hands-on analysis. So this might be good for new lab members or students to contribute to your lab as soon as possible. GitHub can reduce friction for open science: lets us publish and communicate without a lot of heavy lifting! 7.2 What is GitHub? — Traditional answer GitHub means GitHub.com; it’s a company. It centers around git, which is powerful version control software for your local computer. This has been around for years, taking care of bookkeeping for you locally on your computer. GitHub makes git collaborative through a powerful online platform. It will weave together all the bookkeeping from your local computer with other collaborators you work with. It is used for code and files: organize, archive, bookkeeping, searchable, changes visualized, etc. We aren’t going to teach traditional git/GitHub today, but here are 2 recommended tutorials from OHI-Science’s data-science-training. This teaches you how to set up GitHub to sync directly through RStudio, so that you don’t have to have any other software (including the command line) open to do so: GitHub Collaborating with GitHub Note: locally, I interact with GitHub through RStudio 99.9% of the time (use command line .1% of time). There is also a chapter on R, RStudio, and RMarkdown. 7.3 What is GitHub? — Non-traditional answer 7.3.1 Publishing platform It’s for books, websites, interactive dashboards 7.3.2 Project management system It’s a project management system for short and long-term tasks. Really powerful to have collaborative todo’s in the same software (and user accounts) as all the analysis and all the people that you’re already working with. We will talk about “Issues” &amp; “Projects” in the next chapter 7.4 Github framework in a nutshell 7.4.1 Users vs. organizations Example: jules32 vs. openscapes. You can think of them like other social media accounts: I can be an individual or part of a group, and there are permissions associated with both. 7.4.2 Repositories (“repos”) Repos are GitHub’s main unit. They are essentially a folder, and you’ll put files and folders in them. They are contained, with permissions specific to each one. It makes it easier to navigate through and find stuff — so you are “not sifting through a zoo of files”. 7.4.3 “Commits” &amp; “commit messages” Unlike Dropbox or Google Drive that constantly sync to the cloud, you have to deliberately say when you have an amount of work that you want to be versioned and synced. You have to commit to it. GitHub takes care of the backend bookkeeping involved, but you have to write a human-readable message to your future self and others. That is the commit message. Leave breadcrumbs for yourself. 7.4.4 Public vs private 7.4.5 Search feature is awesome This helps so much for navigating through the zoo of files. 7.5 GitHub Orientation This is a demo 7.6 Editing files from GitHub. This is also a demo, but we covered: First a Disclaimer: you don’t want to edit from the browser for most things – you would want to “clone” the repo to your local computer and leverage more goodies &amp; power. However, you will sometimes edit in the browser, and it’s a good entry point for us today, and maybe for onboarding folks in your lab in the future. In the demo, the example .md was a deliberate example of sharing slides from a talk :) What to do: (you all have permissions) Go to https://github.com/openscapes/demoyourname.md Click on the pencil to edit your file Make many edits &amp; commits with commit messages Github.com has a default message, but get into the habit of writing an actual message to yourself/others (breadcrumbs) This is different from saving (cancel if you save!)

Using project management software is a strategy used by every software developer/person working on projects with many moving parts. Streamlines technical discussions with people who are coming/joining a group. Organizes and tracks projects that single or multiple &amp; overlapping users can be a part of. 8.2 What are Issues? Every repo has issues. Issues “track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.” - GitHub help article Create an issue for a topic, track progress, others ask questions, provide links and updates, close issue when completed Public repo – anyone with a username can create and comment on issues. Private repo – only users with permission can create and comment on issues, or see them at all GitHub search is awesome – will search code and issues! 8.3 Issues in the Wild Examples of “traditional” and “non-traditional” use of issues: ggplot2: Bug reports, code, feature, &amp; help requests MozillaFestival: Project submissions and progress tracking OHI-Science: Private conversations and archiving (no link because this is a private repo: we use issues in place of email to have private, archived, searchable conversations about scientific methods. Instead of important science conversations lost in forwarded emails, texts, or slack, onboarding and offboarding is much smoother). 8.4 How to use Issues (demo) Creating a new issue Writing Markdown help Commenting Tagging people Labels, Milestones, Projects, &amp; even more 8.5 Strategies for Issues Every repo has issues, but do you want to use issues in every repo? Consider the purpose: - “Traditional” bug/features for code: keep it public within that repo - “Non-traditional” lab &amp; science conversations: make private, think ahead: will the code/contents of that repo be made public in the future? OHI thought process &amp; strategy: - Although we have many repos, sanity-wise didn’t want to have to search across repos to find a conversation (although now GH can search across organization!) - We also wanted our repos to be public, but to have private conversations - So we created a single private repo called “issues” that we only use for issues. 8.6 Practice creating &amp; commenting on issues Go to github.com/openscapes/demo/issues Create an issue, tag people in your breakout group (ask their username) Browse issues, comment in other issues Try: Linking to your .md document Creating a label and applying it, assigning people Adding issues to a Project (create one if need be) Closing an issue Have fun!
