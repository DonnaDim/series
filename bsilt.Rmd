# Better science in less time {#bsilt}

<!--- *Alternative chapter title: "R: not just for code anymore"* --->

We will highlight some concepts brought up in 

[Lowndes *et al. 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution*: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). 


## OHI pathway 
Motivated by necessity  
Improved by possibility & community   

Gives us more time to do other things (like focus on science)

### Shared workflows not only useful for shared projects

OHI team: we work on many different projects, still use same workflows and share feedback 

Shared conventions reduce friction

Common ground, easier to talk about, easier to ask for help

Identify collaborative opportunities
- Reduce cognitive load
- You don’t need to design everything from scratch

Easier to find things 


## Resources to highlight

### Not so standard deviation podcast 

Parker & Peng  
<http://nssdeviations.com>  
Great discussions about data concepts and “in the wild”  
[Episode 9: Spreadsheet drama](http://nssdeviations.com/episode-9-spreadsheet-drama)

### Practical computing for biologists 

Haddock & Dunn  
<http://practicalcomputing.org/>  
Software & computing concepts already on your computer  
Chapter 2: Regular expressions  

## R for science communication

OHI Team
<http://ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime/>

Website built with R/RMarkdown & Github  
List of media & lectures, resources  
Interviews in Nature, rOpenSci  
Example of what you can do ([1-hour tutorial](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/)) 

## Seaside chats

Ocean Health Index:

- Standing meeting, 1hr 1x/week
- Ours are lab members only (not the lab lead)
- Topic planned ahead
- Usually low effort, but not always
  - I need to learn Zotero, I’ll share what I know by next week
  - Hey, could you show us how you use GitHub?
- We keep a list of topics
  - helps with onboarding new members
  
## Table 1

Took us a long time to make this, really difficult to parse out what we were doing so that we could improve.

## Pathway

Let's use the BSILT Table 1 as a way to help you think of how you work now and identify your paths forward. 

Deliberately identify: 

1. data workflow practices in your lab 
22 next steps to facilitate efficiency and open culture. 

Will help create protocols for shared lab practices – important for onboarding.

<!---

Also, see interviews (i.e. shorter summaries) about it: 

- lab’s workflows & shared practices for data analysis
- collaboration channels
- on/offboarding
- seaside chats
- come for the efficiency, stay for the learning & support community

 From then to now: improving reproducibility and collaboration

We thought we were doing reproducible science. Compared with 5 years later: actually doing reproducible science

Fig 1, Table 1. 

 Reproducibility

 Data preparation: coding and documenting.

 Modelling: R functions and packages.

Version control.

 Organization

 Collaboration within our team

 Coding collaboratively.

 Our (simplified) GitHub workflow.

 Internal communication. 

 Communication outside the project

Sharing data and code.

 Sharing methods and instruction.
