# Better science in less time {#bsilt}

<!--- *Alternative chapter title: "R: not just for code anymore"* --->

We will highlight some concepts brought up in 

[Lowndes *et al. 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution*: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). 



## A few high level things

### Figure 1

### Shared workflows not only useful for shared projects



<!---

Also, see interviews (i.e. shorter summaries) about it: 

- labâ€™s workflows & shared practices for data analysis
- collaboration channels
- on/offboarding
- seaside chats
- come for the efficiency, stay for the learning & support community

## From then to now: improving reproducibility and collaboration

We thought we were doing reproducible science. Compared with 5 years later: actually doing reproducible science

Fig 1, Table 1. 

## Reproducibility

### Data preparation: coding and documenting.

### Modelling: R functions and packages.

### Version control.

### Organization

## Collaboration within our team

### Coding collaboratively.

### Our (simplified) GitHub workflow.

### Internal communication. 

## Communication outside the project

### Sharing data and code.

### Sharing methods and instruction.
